                        <p class="faq-answer">No, wine and liquor bottles are not eligible for the 5¢ deposit in New York State, so we do not accept them as part of our pickup service. Look for the "NY 5¢" marking to identify eligible containers.</p>

                        <p class="faq-answer">No, we can only accept containers with the "NY 5¢" marking, as these are the only ones redeemable in New York State. Containers from other states (like Connecticut or Massachusetts) are not eligible.</p>

                        <p class="faq-answer">Most juice containers and milk bottles are not eligible for deposit in New York State. The only exceptions would be certain juice containers that specifically have the "NY 5¢" marking.</p>
